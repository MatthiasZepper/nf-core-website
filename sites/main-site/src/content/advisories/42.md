## Issue

In a groundbreaking discovery that has sent shockwaves through the computational biology community, we have identified a critical mistake in our pipelines that affects the calculation of the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. This advisory is of the utmost importance as it impacts the fundamental understanding of...well...Everything.

The incompatibility was first discovered when Deep Thought attempted to calculate the Answer using our standard pipeline configuration. The result, while technically correct (42), was found to be incompatible with the current understanding of the Question. This has led to several unintended consequences:

1. Agrajag process no longer terminates unexpectedly with the error code 137.
2. The drink formerly referred to as Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is now served with trendy new flavors and nicknamed Virgin Galactic Gag Reflex.
3. The Infinite Improbability Drive storage has proven finite when our Nextflow `work` directory exceeded it's capacity.
4. Babel fish translations have started including Nextflow DSL1 again.

## Affected Components

The issue affects multiple aspects of our computational infrastructure:

### Pipelines
- The Hitchhiker's Guide pipeline
- Vogon Poetry Analysis pipeline
- Babel Fish Translation pipeline
- Infinite Probability Drive storage

### Modules
- Heart of Gold engine
- Restaurant at the End of the Universe reservation system
- Infinite Improbability Drive core

### Subworkflows
- Tea making procedures
- Towel folding algorithms
- Vogon poetry analysis routines

## Technical Details

The incompatibility stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the Question. While our pipelines correctly calculate the Answer (42), they fail to account for the fact that the Question input channel itself was never properly instantiated. This has led to a cascade of issues in our computational infrastructure.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, we recommend:

1. Always carry a towel
2. **Don't panic!**
3. Update all affected components to the latest versions
4. Keep a copy of the Guide handy

So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!
